whats up guys! âœ¨

This solution was a little different from the others I've done so far, which made me learn a new way of doing "a responsive way" I learned to use media query to provide responsiveness to different devices.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query


### Continued development

I found a limitation in my codes of using relative measurements such as vw, vh, em and others. I'm not yet familiar with these measurements, but I hope to improve my way of building responsive websites.
